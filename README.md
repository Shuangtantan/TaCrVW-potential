# TaCrVW- Moment Tensor Potential (MTP)
This floder contains the training and testing datasets for Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) development and th efinal potential file of Ta-Cr-V-W high entropy alloy system. 
train_dft.cfg file contains training data (structures, energies, forces, stress);
test_dft.cfg file contains general testing data;
addi_dft.cfg file contains additional testing data;
pot.mtp file is the final obtained MTP.
